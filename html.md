# intro to html

start by telling the interwebs what ur doin: <br>
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

then what language you're writing in: <br>
```
<html lang="en_us">
```

the head looks like dis: <br>
**title** is for what text you want to show up on the browser tab
```
<head>
  <title>hi</title>
</head>
```

the hierarchy of headers goes like dis: <br>
```
<h1>
<h2>
<h3>
```

and the body starts with dis: <br>
```
<body>
```

here are things you can do with text: <br>
```
<p>hellow world! this is for a paragraph break</p>
<strong>this makes something bold!</strong>
<i>and this is for italics</i>
```

do this for listing: <br>
```
<ol> ordered list
      1.
      2.
      3.
</ol>
<ul>unordered list <li>helpme</li> </ul>
```

and this is how you make tables! apparently you shouldn't use tables tho lol
```
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
</tbody>
</table>
```

for footers: <br>
```
<footer>teehee foot</footer>
```

for dividers/divisions/no one really knows and spans: <br>
```
<div>block level (for when no other element fits)</div>
<div class "explainer explainer"
           id="header>

<span>inline</span>
```

here's how you link things! <br>
```
<a href="dailybruin.com">a link!</a>
<img src="https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/PETCO/puppy-090517-dog-featured-355w-200h-d
     alt="an image of a dog!">
```

and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus">this</a> is a cool thing that converts things into their coded form<br>

and finally, you conclude with 
```
</body>
</html>
```
yay!
